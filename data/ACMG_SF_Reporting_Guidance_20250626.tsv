Gene Symbol	Reporting Guidance Comment
ABCD1	Hemizygous P/LP variants in males are reportable, as are biallelic P/LP variants in females. If phase is unknown for two heterozygous P/LP variants, the variants are acceptable for return as SFs if the variants do not have prior evidence of existing in cis (on the same copy of the gene). Single heterozygous P/LP variants in females are not reportable as SFs. 
ACTA2	
ACTC1	
ACVRL1	
APC	P/LP variants associated with both classic and attenuated FAP are recommended for return as SFs. At this time, P/LP variants associated with gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS) are not recommended for return as SFs as the actionability for this phenotype may be different than for FAP and has not yet been evaluated by the ACMG SF committee. In addition, GAPPS is caused by P/LP promoter variants which would only be detectable by genome, not exome sequencing (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39039610/)
APOB	Pathogenic missense variants in the LDL-receptor binding domain of apoB impair binding of LDL to the LDL receptor, causing hypercholesterolemia and premature coronary artery disease, the primary features of FH. In contrast, pathogenic variants resulting in reduced secretion of APOB (mainly nonsense and frameshift variants) cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, which is characterized by hypocholesterolemia and resistance to atherosclerosis. Therefore, only P/LP missense variants with documented association with hypercholesterolemia are reportable as SFs.
ATP7B	ATP7B is only reportable if there are biallelic P/LP variants. If phase is unknown for two heterozygous P/LP variants, the variants are acceptable for return if the variants do not have prior evidence of existing in cis (on the same copy of the gene).
BAG3	
BMPR1A	
BRCA1	The pathogenic mechanism for both hereditary breast cancer and Fanconi anemia is the same (loss-of-function), with single heterozygous variants causing breast cancer risk and biallelic variants causing Fanconi anemia. Therefore, P/LP variants that have been identified for either condition are reportable as SFs in the heterozygous or biallelic state.
BRCA2	The pathogenic mechanism for both hereditary breast cancer and Fanconi anemia is the same (loss-of-function), with single heterozygous variants causing breast cancer risk and biallelic variants causing Fanconi anemia. Therefore, P/LP variants identified for either condition are reportable as SFs in the heterozygous or biallelic state.
BTD	BTD is only reportable if there are biallelic P/LP variants. If phase is unknown for two heterozygous P/LP variants, the variants are acceptable for return as SFs if the variants do not have prior evidence of existing in cis (on the same copy of the gene).
CACNA1S	
CALM1	
CALM2	
CALM3	
CASQ2	It is recommended that only P/LP variants associated to autosomal recessive CPVT be returned as SFs as the data supporting dominant inheritance of certain variants is not strong enough to support return as SFs. Also, CASQ2 is only reportable if there are biallelic P/LP variants. If phase is unknown for two heterozygous P/LP variants, the variants are acceptable for return as SFs if the variants do not have prior evidence of existing in cis (on the same copy of the gene).
COL3A1	
CYP27A1	CYP27A1 is only reportable if there are biallelic P/LP variants. If phase is unknown for two heterozygous P/LP variants, the variants are acceptable for return as SFs if the variants do not have prior evidence of existing in cis (on the same copy of the gene).

GAA	GAA is only reportable if there are biallelic P/LP variants. If phase is unknown for two heterozygous P/LP variants, the variants are acceptable for return as SFs if the variants do not have prior evidence of existing in cis (on the same copy of the gene).
GLA	Heterozygous and homozygous P/LP variants in females as well as hemizygous in males are reportable.
HFE	Homozygous p.Cys282Tyr is the only reportable SF result.
HNF1A	
KCNH2	
KCNQ1	Autosomal dominant longQT is due to pathogenic variants in KCNQ1, some of which act through a loss-of-function mechanism and others through a dominant negative gain-of-function mechanism. In contrast, autosomal recessive Jervell and Lange Nielson syndrome is due to pathogenic biallelic loss-of-function variants. P/LP variants implicated in either LQT or JLNS are reportable as SFs.
LDLR	
LMNA	P/LP LMNA variants that have any case level phenotype evidence of association with cardiac disease (eg, DCM, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, and/or arrhythmia) should be reported as SFs, whereas previously reported P/LP missense variants never associated with cardiac disease should not be reported. Also, for novel pLOF variants that reach LP without case observations, these variants should be reported given the general association of pLOF LMNA variants with cardiac disease and the evidence summary should include mention of the spectrum of phenotypes that may be observed with LMNA pLOF variation.
MAX	
MEN1	
MLH1	The pathogenic mechanism for both Lynch syndrome and mismatch repair cancer syndrome is the same (loss-of-function), with single heterozygous variants causing Lynch and biallelic variants causing mismatch repair cancer syndrome. Therefore, P/LP variants identified for either condition are reportable as SFs in the heterozygous or biallelic state.
MSH2	The pathogenic mechanism for both Lynch syndrome and mismatch repair cancer syndrome is the same (loss-of-function), with single heterozygous variants causing Lynch and biallelic variants causing mismatch repair cancer syndrome. Therefore, P/LP variants identified for either condition are reportable as SFs in the heterozygous or biallelic state.
MSH6	The pathogenic mechanism for both Lynch syndrome and mismatch repair cancer syndrome is the same (loss-of-function), with single heterozygous variants causing Lynch and biallelic variants causing mismatch repair cancer syndrome. Therefore, P/LP variants identified for either condition are reportable as SFs in the heterozygous or biallelic state.
MUTYH	MUTYH is only reportable if there are biallelic P/LP variants. If phase is unknown for two heterozygous P/LP variants, the variants are acceptable for return as SFs if the variants do not have prior evidence of existing in cis (on the same copy of the gene).
MYBPC3	
MYH11	
MYH7	Loss-of-function variants in MYH7 are NOT known to be associated with disease in the heterozygous state. Distinct pathogenic variants in MYH7 have been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and MYH7-related skeletal myopathy through different molecular mechanisms. Most HCM related variants are located in the head domain potentially affecting actin binding sites. DCM has been associated with variants that produce an abnormal protein with reduced function. Variants associated to skeletal myopathy are usually located in the rod domain and may be due to a dominant negative mechanism. Note: This text was summarized from ClinGenâ€™s gene-disease validity evidence summaries for MYH7. https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/genes/HGNC:7577 The ACMG Secondary Findings working group recommends that P/LP variants associated with cardiomyopathy, but not skeletal myopathy be returned as SFs.
MYL2	
MYL3	
NF2	
OTC	Heterozygous and homozygous P/LP variants in females as well as hemizygous in males are reportable.
PALB2	The pathogenic mechanism for both hereditary cancer and Fanconi anemia is the same (loss-of-function), with single heterozygous variants causing hereditary cancer and biallelic variants causing Fanconi anemia. Therefore, P/LP variants identified for either condition are reportable as SFs in the heterozygous or biallelic state.
PCSK9	The mechanism of pathogenicity for hypercholesterolemia is gain-of-function variants. LOF variants should not be reported as SFs as they are associated with low levels of LDL cholesterol.
PKP2	
PLN	The typical inheritance for PLN related cardiomyopathy is autosomal dominant, albeit autosomal recessive inheritance has been noted and appears to follow a dosage effect or semidominance, as loss of both alleles results in an earlier and more severe phenotypic presentation (PMID: 12639993). Missense, pLOF and promoter variants have all been reported as pathogenic. Given that PLN only has one exon, most variants, including pLOFs, result in a protein product. There is no observed difference in molecular mechanism(s) underlying the various forms of cardiomyopathy including dilated, hypertrophic and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Both interfamilial and intrafamilial variability are observed between PLN variants (PMID: 12639993, 22820313). Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Intrinsic cardiomyopathy. There is a relatively common Dutch founder pathogenic variant NM_002667.5 c.37AGA[1] (p.Arg14del) that may be present in up to 10-15% of patients with DCM or ARVC in the Netherlands. Note, this information was summarized from ClinGen's gene-disease validity evidence summaries for PLN: https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/genes/HGNC:9080
PMS2	The pathogenic mechanism for both Lynch syndrome and mismatch repair cancer syndrome is the same (loss-of-function), with single heterozygous variants causing Lynch and biallelic variants causing mismatch repair cancer syndrome. Therefore, P/LP variants identified for either condition are reportable as SFs in the heterozygous or biallelic state.
PRKAG2	
PTEN	
RB1	
RBM20	
RET	The mechanism of pathogenicity for multiple endocrine neoplasia is gain-of-function. LOF variants should not be reported as SFs.
RPE65	Only variants associated with autosomal recessive disease are suggested for SF return by the ACMG SF working group. There is currently only one valid dominant pathogenic variant and individuals with this variant are not eligible for gene therapy and therefore this variant is not recommended for return as a SF at this time. Also, RPE65 is only reportable if there are biallelic P/LP variants. If phase is unknown for two heterozygous P/LP variants, the variants are acceptable for return if the variants do not have prior evidence of existing in cis (on the same copy of the gene).
RYR1	P/LP variants in RYR1 can be associated with either malignant hyperthermia or a neuromuscular phenotype. Only P/LP variants associated with malignant hyperthermia should be reported as SFs.

SMAD3	
SMAD4	P/LP variants in SMAD4 are linked to juvenile polyposis with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (JP/HHT) syndrome, juvenile intestinal polyposis syndrome (JPS), and Myhre syndrome. P/LP variants causal for JP/HHT and JPS are due to heterozygous loss-of-function variants and are reportable as SF results. Myhre syndrome, a multi-system disorder involving intellectual disability, is caused by one of four SMAD4 missense variants [c.1498A>G (p.Ile500Val); c.1499T>C (p.Ile500Thr); c.1500A>G (p.Ile500Met), and c.1486C>T (p.Arg496Cys)] and is not on the list of reportable diseases. Variants for Myhre syndrome should not be returned.
STK11	
TGFBR1	P/LP missense variants in the intracellular kinase domain of TGFBR1 are known to cause Loeys-Dietz syndrome with unclear molecular mechanism which could include gain-of-function and dominant negative. These variants are returnable as SFs. In contrast, truncating variants or missense variants in the receptor domain of TGFBR1 cause multiple self-healing squamous epithelioma (MSSE; OMIM 132800) with loss-of-function mechanism and are not returnable as SFs.

TPM1	
TRDN	The MANE Select transcript, NM_006073.4, which has 41 exons, is not the relevant transcript for cardiac disease reporting. Variants should only be reported in exons 1-8 of NM_001256021.1, the predominant transcript in cardiac tissue. Also, TRDN is only reportable if there are biallelic P/LP variants. If phase is unknown for two heterozygous P/LP variants, the variants are acceptable for return if the variants do not have prior evidence of existing in cis (on the same copy of the gene).
TSC1	
TSC2	
TTN	Frameshift, nonsense, and splice-impacting variants in TTN exons with high PSI (see references PMCID: PMC4560092; PMC5201198; http://cardiodb.org/titin) should be evaluated for pathogenicity and returned as SFs if classified as P/LP for dilated cardiomyopathy. Distinct pathogenic variants are associated with different forms of both AD and AR muscle disease (see ClinGen GCEP reports) and are not recommended for return as SFs.
